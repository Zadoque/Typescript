# TypeScript Basic Exercises

This folder contains basic TypeScript exercises focused on type annotations and fundamental data types.

## Exercises

1. **String Type Exercise**
   - Create a variable to store your address as a string
   - Use type annotation to ensure only strings can be assigned to it

2. **Function with Numbers Exercise**
   - Create a function that accepts two numbers as arguments
   - Return their sum
   - Use type annotations to ensure only numbers can be passed as arguments

3. **Boolean Type Exercise**
   - Create a variable to store whether it is raining or not
   - Use boolean type annotation

## Expected Learning Outcomes

- Understanding basic TypeScript type annotations
- Working with primitive types (string, number, boolean)
- Creating typed functions in TypeScript

## Solution Structure

Each exercise has its own file:
- `exercise1.ts` - String type exercise
- `exercise2.ts` - Function with numbers exercise
- `exercise3.ts` - Boolean type exercise
